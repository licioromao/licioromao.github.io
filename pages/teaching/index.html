<div class="student-feedback"><strong>Students feedback:</strong> &#39;&#39;Licioâ€™s been a brilliant tutor this year. I found B15 quite challenging overall but Licio was incredibly supportive and provided good explanations, and extra little resources during the tutorial which were also very helpful.&#39;&#39;; &#39;&#39;Very good tutor. Even provided his own notes on the subject so as to give us another explanation/description of the topics which was very helpful.  Good explainer. He would sometimes ask us to run through a problem on the board which would keep us on our toes, but it&#39;s good to try these out as a student, as you can show him step-by-step what you&#39;re doing which is good for learning.&#39;&#39;</div>
